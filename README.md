The Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern is a popular software design pattern used for developing user interfaces. It separates an application into three main components: Model, View, and Controller. The Model represents the data and business logic of the application, while the View is responsible for displaying the data to the user. The Controller acts as an intermediary between the Model and View, receiving input from the user via the View and updating the Model accordingly.
